===============================
This is a simple arcade game, like frogger, that requires the user to dodge
enemies while trying to achieve a high score by collecting gems.

This was a project for the online Udacity Front-end development class. The base
was cloned from a udacity starter that provided images, an initial game engine
and a rendering of the gameboard. It can be found here:
https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

Getting Started
=================
To play the game download the files from the repository and open the 'index.html'

Playing the game
==================
When the game loads you can use the left <- and right -> arrow keys to navigate
to the character you want. 'Enter' will make the selection and start the game.

In the game you can use the 'up', 'down', 'left', and 'right' keys to move the
character around the screen. Collect gems to push your score higher. Watch out
for enemies and the water, these will take away a life point.

At the end of the game press your score will show. Use 'Enter' key to begin again.
