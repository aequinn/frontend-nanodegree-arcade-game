The base\r\nwas cloned from a udacity starter that provided images, an initial game engine\r\nand a rendering of the gameboard. It can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n=================\r\nTo play the game download the files from the repository and open the 'index.html'\r\n\r\nPlaying the game\r\n==================\r\nWhen the game loads you can use the left <- and right -> arrow keys to navigate\r\nto the character you want. 'Enter' will make the selection and start the game.\r\n\r\nIn the game you can use the 'up', 'down', 'left', and 'right' keys to move the\r\ncharacter around the screen. Collect gems to push your score higher. Watch out\r\nfor enemies and the water, these will take away a life point.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the game your score will show. Use 'Enter' key to begin again.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
